## Introduction

This model simply changes the algo and eventually the target. The idea is to try different approach to see anything beats the `naive bayes` results...and to show other ways of creating the model.

As with the `naive_bayes_model.rmd` file, the data is loaded and the irrelevant features removed. (Refer the `naive_bayes_model.rmd` introduction for more information.) This provides a summary of the data too.

```r {}
source('load_trim_data.R')

```
