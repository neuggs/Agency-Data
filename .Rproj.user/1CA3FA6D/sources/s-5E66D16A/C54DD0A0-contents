## Agency Data Codebook

This codebook shows a summary of (some) agency data. It is no a comprehensive set of data, since each agency management system has different export capabilities and individual agencies have access to different independent data from carriers (e.g., loss runs).

```{r}
makeCodebook(agency_data)
```
